# LadyBug

"NanoProtoPull - Inspired by the 'BlueSteel Ladybug' found in serene blue forests, it's a minimalist and efficient Protocol Buffers (protobuf) pull parser. This C++ library is designed for resource-constrained environments, offering powerful parsing capabilities in a tiny footprint. Ideal for embedded systems and constrained devices, NanoProtoPull enables swift and nimble processing of protobuf messages, making it perfect for compact protocols."

## Motivation

In resource-constrained environments, like embedded systems, finding an efficient parser for large and complex Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages can be a challenge. Existing parsers designed for smaller messages often fall short when dealing with intricate protobuf models.
For instance, while parsing ONNX files, the complexity of the underlying protobuf messages surpassed the capabilities of standard parsers. Generating specific code for parsing added unnecessary overhead, which is undesirable in constrained environments.
To address these limitations, I decided to develop a pull-based parser. This parser aims to efficiently handle protobuf messages of any size and complexity without sacrificing performance. By avoiding code generation and specialized parsing, it becomes an ideal choice for constrained environments.
Inspired by the idea of simplicity and efficiency, this parser library offers seamless integration into resource-constrained projects. Its lightweight design minimizes memory and processing requirements, making it perfect for handling complex ONNX models and other large protobuf messages.
Through this parser library, developers can navigate the world of complex protobufs effortlessly, unlocking new possibilities for intelligent systems in resource-constrained environments. Let's harness the power of this tiny yet potent pull parser to handle Protocol Buffers with ease. Together, let's explore the blue forest of data processing in constrained environments.
